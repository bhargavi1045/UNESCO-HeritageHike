           <p>Nalanda was a renowned Buddhist mahavihara (great monastery) in ancient Magadha (modern-day Bihar), eastern India.[4][5][6] Nalanda is considered to be among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world. It was located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kilometres (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna). Operating from 427 until 1197 CE,[7][8] Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE, a period that has since been described as the "Golden Age of India" by scholars.</p>
           <p> Nalanda was established during the Gupta Empire era (c. 3rd-6th century CE),and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons -both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Nalanda continued to thrive with the support of the rulers of the Pala Empire (r. 750-1161 CE). After the fall of the Palas, the institution was eventually abandoned. Nalanda may have been attacked and damaged by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji (c. 1200), but it also managed to remain operational for decades (or possibly even centuries) following the raids.</p>
           <p>The current site of Nalanda is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2010, the Government of India passed a resolution to revive the famous university, and a contemporary institute, Nalanda University, was established at Rajgir. It has been listed as an "Institute of National Importance" by the Government of India.</p>
