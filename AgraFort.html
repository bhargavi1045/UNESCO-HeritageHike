           <p>Silhouetted against the modern skies of Agra with air that still whispers the skirmishes of the past and every swish of the wind rings in a welter of bellicose noises from the many battles fought for its possession - Agra Fort is a grand legend in the Mughal narrative. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Agra Fort is also known as Red Fort or Lal Qila of Agra because of the red sandstone. Built in 1565 by Akbar- the venerated Mughal emperor, the fort also goes by the name of Qila-e-Akbari for it was refurbished under his aegis with the signature markings evident - the Indo-Islamic Akbari architecture. It was his grandson Shah Jahan who pulled down the earlier structures and erected new ones made of white marble - the one he was fond of. The fort served as a residence for the Mughal royalty until 1638 after which the royal house moved to the Red Fort in the new Mughal pleasure capital, Shahjahanabad now known as Old Delhi famous for its grotty, nostalgia-stoking lanes. </p>

           <h3> Agra Fort History </h3> <br>
            Situated just 3 km from the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort was built on the banks of Yamuna as a defence to keep the enemy forces at bay. The rampart is 20 metres high and its walls are 2.5 km wide. The fort is a walled city comprising several structures which were demolished by various rulers only to be replaced by new preferences. The fort consists of four gates and the two main gates are: the Delhi gate and the Lahore gate. The Delhi gate was exclusively meant for Akbar and his security. It is now under the control of the Indian Army. The Lahore gate is now known as the Amar Singh gate and is the only gate for entrance to the Agra Fort.
            
            Agra Fort has had many invaders and seen the rule of many dynasties resulting in its constant transformations. Babur took the control of the fort after defeating Ibrahim Lodi in 1526. The fort was now home to the Mughal supremacy and an object of envy for the rest. Sher Shah Suri in 1540 defeated Humayun and the new owner of the fort made changes to it to suit his tastes. Fifteen years later in 1555, Humayun usurped the Sur rulers and reclaimed the fort only to lose it again a year later. But soon Akbar waged a war against the Surs and was able to take control of the fort once again. By this time the fort started to lose its sheen and in 1556 Akbar rebuilt the entire fort with red sandstone. After the death of Shah Jahan the fort was captured by the Maratha rulers who lost it to the British, and was later handed over to the Indian government post Independence.</p>
